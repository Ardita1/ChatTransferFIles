# ChatTransferFiles

The main purpose of this project has been to create communication channels between users with the ability to send files using the
RMI platform.
One of the users should "play" the role of the server by activating or releasing the server.
Its IP address is used by other users to access the same server in order to achieve communication and file sharing. 
Apart from the role of the server, users can also be their clients and attach communication with other clients. 
Sending and saving files is done by turning the byte file for a better and faster sending option.
